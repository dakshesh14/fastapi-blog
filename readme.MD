# FastAPI Blogs Application

I made this project to get more comfortable with implementing core concepts such as middleware, jwt authentication, and database operations. Now a days, you can just use frameworks such as Django, Spring-boot, or Express to get a lot of these features out of the box. These frameworks are great and I use them all the time, but I wanted to understand how they work under the hood.

With this project I aim to implement the following features:

- [ ] User Authentication
- [ ] Blog CRUD operations
- [ ] Comment CRUD operations
- [ ] Various middleware operations
- [ ] Unit tests (probably)
